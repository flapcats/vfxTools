Track any point in Maya using locators and a scaled camera[edit]
Load the tracked camera its undistorted backplate
Set the frame range and choose a frame where the point you want to track is clearly visible.
Create a locator, look through the camera and move the locator to the point you want to track.
Duplicate the camera without upstream connections on that frame, turn off its renderable flag, unlock its transform attributes and rename it locatorCam_#### (frame number)
(or something you'll not accidentally render later.)
Remove it from any grouping and parent the locator to it - ie MM drag the locator onto the cam.
This gives you a transform that has the same attributes as the camera.
Change to a frame where the point has moved significantly, look through the tracked camera.
Select 'locatorCam' and scale it until the locator lines up with the point you'd like tracked.
Repeat this for several frames in the shot, scaling and refining the scale to improve the track.

Using OpenStreetMap[edit]
OpenStreetMap can be used to extract OBJs from any map.
Export a .map region file from OpenStreetMap - Click the Export button at the top of the page. The default area is the viewport, but you can also manually change that.
Make sure the property you want is completely within the export region, then click the blue Export button to download the file.
An example area: http://www.openstreetmap.org/search?query=st%20michaels%20hamburg#map=18/53.54786/9.97996
Convert the OSM .map file to an OBJ model with OSM2World, a free Java program for converting OSM data into 3D models.
/mnt/projects/library/openStreetMap_geoExtract
Open the .map file in OSM2World with File > Open, then export the whole thing as an OBJ via File > Export OBJ file. That's it.
In a shell: ./osm2world.sh --input map.osm --output map.obj
Import the OBJ

Using SED to Change Data Inside a File[edit]
Example for changing a path to another path for every .ass in the pwd - use with caution.
find . -name '*.ass' -exec sed -i 's!E:/Sam/Documents/Freelance Work/Aftermath/Aftermath_Maya/textures/!/mnt/projects/aft/publish/assets/hamburg/textures/!g' '{}' \;
