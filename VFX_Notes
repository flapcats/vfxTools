Track any point in Maya using locators and a scaled camera[edit]
Load the tracked camera its undistorted backplate
Set the frame range and choose a frame where the point you want to track is clearly visible.
Create a locator, look through the camera and move the locator to the point you want to track.
Duplicate the camera without upstream connections on that frame, turn off its renderable flag, unlock its transform attributes and rename it locatorCam_#### (frame number)
(or something you'll not accidentally render later.)
Remove it from any grouping and parent the locator to it - ie MM drag the locator onto the cam.
This gives you a transform that has the same attributes as the camera.
Change to a frame where the point has moved significantly, look through the tracked camera.
Select 'locatorCam' and scale it until the locator lines up with the point you'd like tracked.
Repeat this for several frames in the shot, scaling and refining the scale to improve the track.
